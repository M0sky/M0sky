## Project Features

- **Frequency and Timing Declaration**: 
  The frequencies used were obtained from [this source](https://www.liutaiomottola.com/formulae/freqtab.htm).
  Each bar has a duration of 1600 ms.

- **Keyboard Shortcut Control**: 
  A function has been created to capture the `Ctrl+C` shortcut, ensuring an orderly script termination. Additionally, the mouse pointer is hidden during execution using `tput civis` and restored with `tput cnorm`.

- **Note Durations**:
  - Quarter notes: 400 ms (1/4 of a bar).
  - Triplets: 133 ms x 3.
  - Half notes: 800 ms (2/4 of a bar).
  - Eighth notes: 200 ms (1/8 of a bar).
  - Sixteenth notes: 100 ms (1/16 of a bar).
  - Rests have durations aligned with the respective note values.
  
  All durations are calculated for a 4/4 time signature. A delay (`-D`) of 50 ms has been added to slightly speed up the playback.
